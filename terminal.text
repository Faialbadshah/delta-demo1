ls = list files (show my files)
pwd = print working directory
clear = clear screen 

Navigation 
means inside & outside diretoroies 

we use cd= change directory 
to go in js , write cd js , then we go into js folder then ls to see it's folder then we can go into that 
by writing cd nameOfFolder , now to see where we are by pwd 

to come back from folder one step back by cd .. to do two step cd ../.. 
to go to directyly into next folder by skiping one write cd desktop/delta then you will directly go in delta 

if there is delta in desktop but desktop is in user but we are currently in desktop then we can open delta by cd destop/delta and this is relative path 

but it's abosolute path will be cd /user/desktop/delta

/ = root directory
to create forlder we use mkdir ~ makedirectory , in which ever directory you want to make new folder "Go into that and --> mkdir NewFolder" , making folder by relative path mkdir 'only code'/NewDir/NewOFnew then NewOFnew got creted i NewDir 

additional thigs that work with function called flags means ls print file normally but ls -la give some hidden file 


flags are character that we pass with commands to modify thier behaviour  
we can combine two flags like ls -a and ls -l by ls -la

********Touch commands*********
used to makes file like this --> go in folder and touch index.html then it will be created in that

        ****Deleting Files & folder
rm -fileName - delete file to delete multiple rm -1name 2name
rmdir -forldrName -delete empty folder 
rm -rf -folderName -delete any folder
