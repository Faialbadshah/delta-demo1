to ***(clone)*** a repository on our local machine   ---> git clone <-some link ->
git status --> it give what's status of our folder is going on 

whenever we modified our work it goes to staged and if we commit then final stamp will be applied on it 

to **(add files)** , git add fileName , to add all file  at once git add .
to **(add all)** thing in a specific directory write which is inside a folder add git nameOfDirectory/

***(commit)*** - it is the record of change , --> git commit -m "some message"

***(push)*** - to upload these changes to gitHub means push upload local repo to remote ropo , git push origin main

************three stages to completely show in gitHub************** 
git add .: Stages all the modified and new files.
git commit -m "message": Commits the staged changes with a message.
git push origin main: Pushes your local main branch to the remote repository.

git pull origin main --rebase: Syncs your local repository with remote changes.
git push origin main: Pushes your local changes to the remote repository.  
origin means place of repo , and main means branche

    instead of ls -a to find hidden file use 
    1.Get-ChildItem -Force
    2.ls -Force
    3.Get-ChildItem -Recurse -Force

        if we not make .git in new folder git will not track it 
        ***Init*** - used to create a new git repo  by --> git init

        Use separate folders and repositories to keep projects organized, avoid nested repositories, and ensure clean and independent version control.
        If you mistakenly create a repository inside another, you can clean it up by removing the .git folder (rm -rf .git) or carefully reorganizing your folders.



    ***git remote add origin <-link->*** , this is for giving project created here to gitHub
    remote means jaha code push karna hai or orgin se jagah bata rahe hai
    ye local system repo ko gitHub mein created same repo ko jod deta hai 

    **git remote -v** to verify remote if we see fetch and push then ok 
    **git branch** (to check branch) means if three friend then they can make three different branches to code same but in their way then they will add it 

git branch -M main (to rename branch)
git push origin main (now we have link repo with git remote) so we can push our code by writing it `

one more things git push -u origin main is setted now we can write git push 
if we don't create an untracked file we are changing in present files then we can add and commit together
by  git commit -am "added something"

****WORKFLOW*** , on gitHub  code change --> commit , in local Git  code change --> add --> commit --> push





            *****branches*****
--> it is used so that we can make initial commit then make many branches and works on diff. code and features 
1. git branch (to check branch)
2. git branch -M main (to rename branch)
3.git checkout -b <-new branch name -> (to create new branch)
4. git checkout <-branch name-> (to navigate)
5. git branch -d <branch name> (TO delete)
